# Fluent Python

[![Python Tests](https://github.com/fubblea/fluent_python/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fubblea/fluent_python/actions/workflows/test.yaml)

These are experiments inspired by the book [Fluent Python 2nd Ed](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359).

Example code from book: https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e

## Tests

All of the doctests are tested using `pytest` and are run as a Github workflow to ensure they work with Python >=3.10
